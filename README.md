# Amazone_Clone
This is a static clone of the Amazon homepage created using HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout and design of the original site, including the header, navigation bar, product sections, and footer. The project focuses on responsive design and clean UI styling to closely mimic the look and feel of Amazon's front page.
